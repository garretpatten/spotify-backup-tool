## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- Spotify Developer Account
- Spotify App credentials

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/garretpatten/spotify-backup-tool.git
cd spotify-backup-tool
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Spotify credentials
```

### Spotify API Setup

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new app
3. Note your Client ID and Client Secret
4. Add `http://localhost:3000/callback` to Redirect URIs
5. Use the [Authorization Code Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/code-flow/) to get your refresh token

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Required Spotify API credentials
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token

# Optional configuration
BACKUP_DIR=./spotify-playlists
LOG_LEVEL=info
COMPRESSION_LEVEL=9
```

### Usage

Run the backup tool:
```bash
npm start
# or
npm run backup
```

The tool will:
1. Authenticate with Spotify API
2. Fetch all your playlists
3. Download track details for each playlist
4. Save playlists as JSON files in `spotify-playlists/` directory
5. Create a timestamped zip archive

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors**
- Ensure your refresh token is valid and not expired
- Verify your Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- Check that your Spotify app has the necessary scopes

**API Rate Limiting**
- The tool includes built-in retry logic
- Adjust `RETRY_ATTEMPTS` and `RETRY_DELAY` if needed
- Consider reducing `PLAYLIST_LIMIT` and `TRACK_LIMIT` for slower connections

**File Permission Errors**
- Ensure the backup directory is writable
- Check available disk space
- Verify file system permissions

### Getting Help

- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/garretpatten/spotify-backup-tool/issues) page
- Review the test files for usage examples
- Enable debug logging: `LOG_LEVEL=debug npm start`
